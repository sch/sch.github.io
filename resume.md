    title: Software Engineer II

      At Microsoft, I worked on [Lobe](https://www.lobe.ai) --- an
      Electron-powered desktop application designed to make machine learning
      accessible to anyone. I have worked on the user interface for image
      classification, systems for exporting ONNX models to Microsoft's Power
      Platform, and integration of the Lobe and Microsoft Fluent design
      languages. I also contributed to the Adaptive Cards project, providing
      rich user interfaces for responses to AI Copilot ChatGPT conversations.

  - name: Consultant
    dates: Feburary 2017 to June 2021

      For four years, I was a contractor working with various companies to
      design and program software.

      Through [Oak](https://oak.is), I helped design and build [the School for
      Visual Arts student portfolio site](http://sva.design).

      Through [Reaktor](https://www.reaktor.com), I helped textbook publisher
      Houghton Mifflin Harcourt prototype alternative textbook interactions and
      assessment software.

      With [Standard Library](https://standard-library.com) and [IN-FO
      CO](http://in-fo.co), I built the exhibition site for the [2018 US
      Architectural Pavilion](http://dimensionsofcitizenship.org) at the Venice
      Biennale.

      With Reaktor, I worked with Adidas to build internal tools to make
      supply chain and garment embellishment information more visible on their
      [Locker Room](https://lockerroom.adidas.co.uk) team ordering storefront.

      Through Reaktor, I also worked with Viacom on a project under NDA.

      All this work has touched many different technologies, including
      Kubernetes, AWS, React, GraphQL, Python, Ruby, Typescript, Swagger, gRPC,
      Postgres, Ruby, Elixir, and Elm.

    title: Lead Frontend Developer

      I was hired to help build the client application for the company's
      internet-of-things [cloudBit](http://littlebits.cc/cloudstart) device.
      This application controls and reads values over a websocket connection
      with a WiFi-connected microcontroller, and allows for lightweight
      scripting using the service If This Then That.

      I built several features in our public-facing website, a Rails
      application, including integration with the cloudBit, our community upload
      feature, and product/shop pages.  I also helped improve application
      performance at both the front-end, database, and AWS level.

      I then worked in a research-and-development capacity on a [learn-to-code
      product](http://littlebits.cc/code-kit) aimed at the education market.

      On the programming side, I split time between developing user interface
      prototypes for high-level product design considerations and building out
      necessary libraries for communicating with hardware from a web context.
      This included a wrapper around the (at-the-time experimental) Web
      Bluetooth apis, a Javascript binary parser and generator library for a USB
      Bluetooth dongle, and a Qt app (later an Electron app) that could provide
      a websocket connection to our Arduino runtime.  On the web side,
      I experimented with various paradigms that could be used as a basis for
      teaching programming, including procedural, event-based, declarative, and
      functional reactive programming. These prototypes were implemented using
      web technologies.

      Non-programming duties included performing market research and competitive
      analysis for the learn-to-code software space, sourcing and synthesizing
      relevant academic research, administering user testing with kids in public
      schools, interviewing educators to gain insight into how programming is
      taught today, and collaborating with teams at Google, Microsoft, Apple,
      and the MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Group.

    title: Software Developer

      I created a customer-facing dashboard using React, D3, and Elasticsearch.
      Implemented the redesign of the main Rails web app in React, extracted
      a component library and documentation tool for front-end assets that
      served as a living styleguide, and built a client and server-side
      analytics abstraction for Google Analytics and Mixpanel.

  - name: Nerdwallet
    dates: April 2013 to May 2014
    title: Software Engineer

      I split a big PHP codebase into a smaller PHP codebase and a handful of
      Python services. I maintained the Wordpress blogs for 40+ authors, and
      built a handful of editor extensions: macros for things like credit card
      previews, up-to-date stock prices, and arbitrary text snippets.  I also
      moved a bunch of the site to a responsive redesign, migrated 25+
      repositories to a single Github deployment, and supervised/code reviewed
      work for one of our remote teams.

  - name: Digital Bungalow

      I implemented responsive design to many of the agency's projects.
      I maintained the Drupal site My Well-Being, worked on the Backbone rewrite
      of Showcase Cinemas, worked on the responsive upgrade of Bob's Furniture,
      and created an RFC for Chilling Effects.

      BS in Computer Science. Studied physics and art, worked as a physics
      teacher's assistant. Ran the tech side of the radio station for three
      years.

I'm a programmer and designer specializing in communication software. That is,
software designed to facilitate people working together to reduce ambiguity,
remove ego, and express complex ideas â€” software that helps everyone get on the
same page.

I've worked with dynamic object-oriented languages (Python, Ruby, Javascript),
dynamic functional languages (Clojure, Elixir, Racket), low-level languages (C,
Go, Forth), and statically typed functional languages (OCaml, Elm).

My main outlet for this kind of work has been through UI development, but
extends to back-end and system development. I love working closely with other
designers and domain experts, and I sweat the details until code is simple to
implement and the product simple to use.
