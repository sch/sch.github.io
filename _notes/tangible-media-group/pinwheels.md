[Pinwheels: Visualizing Information Flow in an Architectural Space][paper]

> We envision that the architectural spaces we inhabit will become an interface
> between humans and online digital information. We have been designing ambient
> information displays to explore the use of kinetic physical objects to present
> information at the periphery of human perception.
>
> This paper reports the design of a large-scale Pinwheels installation made of
> 40 computer-controlled pinwheel units in a museum context. The Pinwheels spin
> in a “wind of bits” that blows from cyberspace. The array of spinning
> pinwheels presents information within an architectural space through subtle
> changes in movement and sound.

> To explore an alternative approach, we are moving information off the screen
> into the physical environment, where it is manifested as subtle changes in
> form, movement, sound, color, smell, temperature, or light. We call such
> displays "ambient displays." We feel that ambient displays are well suited as
> a means of keeping users aware of people, weather, or general states of large
> systems.
