title: Human Universals
---

Alan Kay has a succinct answer to the question: "what should we work on?"

He cites the work of anthropologist Donald Brown, who documented what values all
observed human cultures have in common. Here's a few of more than 300:

- social
- language
- communication
- culture
- fantasies
- stories
- tools and art
- superstition
- religion and magic
- case based learning
- theatre
- play and games
- differences over similarities
- quick reactions to patterns
- loud noises and snakes
- supernormal responses
- vendetta

Non-universals:

- reading and writing
- deductive abstract mathematics
- model based science
- equal rights
- democracy
- perspective drawing
- theory of harmony
- similarities over differences
- slow deep thinking
- agriculture
- legal systems

His argument: find one of these needs not currently met by a technology, and see
if computers can perform of help facilitate the work.
