title: Collaboration Software
---

It's easy for me to think that Dynamicland is the ideal software collaboration
environment: the computer is the room, personal devices and objects in that room
are the interface, the privacy model is the one we're used to.

It's a sea change to get there. There are many incremental steps with the
software we have today. Google Docs-style collaborative editing is the current
north star: an application like Figma or Airtable serves as a flavor of
massively multiplayer Sketch, for example. Real-time editing, multiple cursors,
ephemeral filesystems with versioning. This style has the added benefit of being
served through a web browser, making the barrier to adoption minimal. Many
businesses are reinventing the Microsoft and Adobe suites to be web-native with
this kind of always-on collaboration.

The business advantages are obvious, but are the usability ones so clear? For
writing, many people prefer a more editorial workflow, where distinct drafts can
be volleyed between author and editor. Many authors cite copying their
works-in-progress into a second document, making their changes, and copying them
back when they're finished. [[Ink and switch project]] acknowledged this
workflow in their prototype.
