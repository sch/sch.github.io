OpenDoc was a mid-90s attempt by Apple to delegate rendering and editing of
different media types to multiple apps within the same document.

There's a lot of speculation on why it didn't work out, Geoffry Litt has a good
summary:

> - UX quality. If every component is developed by an independent company, who is responsible for unifying it into a nice holistic experience rather than a mishmash?
> - Modality. Different parts of your document operate with different behaviors.
> - Performance. Huge memory overhead from the complexity
> - Exporting. Hard to export a "whole document" into a different format if it's made of a bunch of different parts.
> - Lack of broad utility. How common are "compound documents" really? Beyond the classic example of "word doc with images and videos embedded"
> - Data format compatibility. If two components both edit spreadsheets but use different data formats, what do you do?
> - Historical accident. Turf wars between Microsoft and everyone else, Steve Jobs ruthlessly prioritizing at Apple, execution failures, etc.

It's worth exploring if the idea is still relevant. Did it attempt to solve
a problem that has since been solved in other ways? Or has something changed in
recent years (performance, platforms, computer literacy) that makes the idea
ripe for a comeback? What apps today implement OpenDoc-like ideas?
