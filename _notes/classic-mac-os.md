[Basilisk Unity Mode](https://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10472)
lets you share classic Mac windows within macOS.

On the ["spatial finder"](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2003/04/finder/), what
makes the finder UI on pre-OSX systems a kind of place you can hang out in.

[Portal](http://macintoshgarden.org/games/portal) is an early experiment in
hypertext/interactive fiction that acts as a boot ROM. The UI replicates Classic
Mac OS with some modern features. A space explorer returns to earth after a 100

scraps of documents.
