Some strategies proposed by archivists on how to preserve media on computers:

| Technique | Description | Pros | Cons |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- |
| Migration | Periodically convert data to the next-generation formats | Data is instantly accessible | Copies degrade from generation to generation |
| Emulation | Mimicking the behavior of older hardware with software, tricking old programs into thinking they are running on their original platforms | Data does not need to be altered | Mimicking is seldom perfect; chains of emulators eventually break down |
| Encapsulation | Encase digital data in physical and software wrappers, showing future users how to reconstruct them | Details of interpreting data are never separated from the data themselves | Must build new wrappers for every new format and software release; works poorly for non textual data |
| Universal virtual computer | Archive paper copies of specifications for a simple, software-defined decoding machine; save all data in a format readable by the machine | Paper lasts for centuries; machine is not tied to specific hardware or software	Difficult to distill specifications into a brief paper document |

The first two methods preserve a technological environment while the second two
overcome the obsolescence of the file format.
