littleBits created a system of magnetically connected circuit building blocks.
It didn't do much to teach you about circuit design and electrical engineering,
but was intended to abstract signal as a toy and prototyping tool.

There's a surprising amount of prior art though. [Lectron] was a tool from
Raytheon in the 60s that encased electronic parts in clear plastic dominoes
with magnets to ensure electrical contact when tiled side-by-side. The problem
it solved was breadboarding: kids especially could more rapidly cobble together
circuits this way, swap out a resistor, change a push button for
a potentiometer, etc. The level of abstraction was certainly that of a Radio
Shack 30-in-one electronics lab.
