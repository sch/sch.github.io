Jef Raskin had some interesting ideas on the usability of operating systems, but
was born at the wrong time. With a new surplus of computing power, an abundance
of display technologies, and dedicated hardware for machine learning, a lot of
his ideas present in "The Humane Interface" can be implemented.

[Mercury](https://www.mercuryos.com) is a OS-level proposal in using some of
Raskin's task-oriented ideas, instead of having a traditional windowed desktop
and file system. [Dot](https://new.computer) by the same designer aims to bring
some of the same metaphors to an AI agent.
