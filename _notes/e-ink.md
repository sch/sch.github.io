E-Ink displays are mostly relegated to 6-8" screens on book readers, but have
some applications in signage and ambient displays. They are purely reflective,
blending into the environment instead of emitting light, which makes them great
for reducing eye strain.

Visonect makes [a 13" battery powered display][place-and-play] for offices, with
a [content management system][visionect-software] for remote updates.

It's possible to [repurpose an e-reader][terminal emulator], which tend to have
screens with higher refresh rates, as a terminal emulator.
