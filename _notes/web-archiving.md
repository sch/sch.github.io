How do we archive web content?

# The formats

You can make a copy of a website by using wget. This will make a copy of the
HTML to a directory and pull down the assets referenced as files in that
directory.

# Hosting copies

Navigating these copies can be challenging when you have hundreds of them. You
may want to link between pages in existing copies, sharing assets like style
sheets and images. You may want to copy a whole subset of a site, and add to it
over time. These files are not static however, so it's important to record when
the sites were crawled.

Archive.org crawls an entire site in a sitting and then makes it possible to
visit the same url at different points in time.
