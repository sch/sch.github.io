What role does testing play in evaluating whether a user interface works?

Technology advances faster than computer literacy. It's not always clear the
difference between a bad interface and a merely unfamiliar one.

> [Evaluation] can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done ‘by rule’
> rather than ‘by thought’. If done during early stage design, it can mute
> creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test
> radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an
> immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done
> to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design’s
> scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would
> be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how
> cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users
> will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance.
