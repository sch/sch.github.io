title: Internet Presence

2023: Twitter has collapsed, generative AI is creating noise, the [hyperlink
has replaced the dollar](https://twitter.com/dril/status/249985527669997568).
People are wondering what kind of web presence they want to have again.

Some have moved to Mastodon and post to a smaller audience. Some have been
baptized and blog again. The big ones blog in newsletter form.

One flavor is the "portfolio with drafts" approach, where you have some polished
works, essays, and portfolio pieces alongside a more braindumpy export of
tools-for-thought-style notes. Usually there's a way of exporting an existing
system of notes (Obsidian, Roam, Arena) in a web publishing step. Here are some
of the good ones:
